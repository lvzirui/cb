# webpack-react-redux-react-router
A complete boilerplate for making apps with react, redux, react-router with the help of webpack. 

![](http://jpsierens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/filterableTable-1.gif)

Contains: 

* a working example of a filterable table which you can play around with (look above).
* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* eslint to keep your js readable
* tests (coming soon, I swears)
* much more...


## Run the app

0. npm install
0. npm start

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```
Yes, it takes a while to load the first time you open the app.
